### iteratie 0 

In iteratie 0 zijn Bram Bastiaan en ik samen gekomen om te brainstormen over een project idee. Het plan is om met zijn 3e voor het [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) platform een add-on te maken die gebruikers zouden kunnen installeren. De plugin gaat de gebruiker helpen om automatiseringen te genereren op basis van hun gedrag/input. 

Om dit plan uit te werken zijn wij meerdere malen bijeen gekomen in teams meetings en op locatie. In deze meetings zijn wij bezig geweest om ons projectplan te formuleren. Om te verifiÃ«ren of ons project aansluit op de leerdoelen van dit semester hebben wij deze in een online sessie gepitcht aan de docenten en de klas. De feedback ([feedback 09-02-2023](feedback%2009-02-2023.md)) die we hebben gekregen was prima. De onderzoeksvraag is groot genoeg om met zijn 3e te doen. De volgende stap was het concreet maken van de hoofdvraag en sub vragen.
